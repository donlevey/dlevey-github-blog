###Networking Fundamentals
This module was, for me, basic review.  In short, we went through many of the things I had learned 30 yeas ago; this was very useful as a refresher, and the most difficult part was making sure I answered in the way that the automated checking would verify.  Certainly a very necessary module for the course of study, but one I had, effectively, already done long ago.

### Web Applications
This one did not focus on exploits of applications per se, but rather the general topic of formulating http/https requests so as to take advantage of potential exploits using malformed or "re-purposed" standard web requests.  This general subject includes things like SQL injection attacks (like the famous "little Bobby Tables" exploit), adding, removing or modifying database records via GET/POST/DELEETE requests, or other things that ride atop of what woud otherwise be "normal" requests (for example, commands to set/reset a cookie, or including session information with a normal connection attempt).  This is a good adjunct to the Web Requests module, and together they provide a good foundation for attacks and strategies to be used in actual testing and attacks.
