# Don Levey

_Documenting my technical projects and journey toward self-education._

## 10-03-2025: My first plost

I've been dipping my toe into GitHub, and it's time to really learn the platform. To that end, I've created a repository (https://github.com/donlevey/dlevey-github-blog) that will journal my education and work in IT Security. Hopefully, I will be able to include posts (such as this) which are of (potentially) general interest, as well as things specific to the technical issues I encounter.

I'll be starting to work on Hack The Box (https://www.hackthebox.com/), so I plan to record my processes, procedures, thoughts, and reports on the modules there. As I increase my knowledge and involvement, I will be (of course) adding new avenues for research as I encounter them. I don't expect I will be making any ground-breaking discoveries, but perhaps this will give people some insight as to my growth in the field, and maybe even provide a few pointers to others beginning this path.

For the sake of those who might be interested, I will try to duplicate (or at least refer to) those various posts on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-levey-100a73268/) and here.
